# Vector Playing Cards

This is a collection of SVG images for a full deck of playing cards (based on [vector-playing-cards][1]) and a script, `svg2png.py`, that converts a folder of SVG files into PNG files of any width.

The `cards-svg` folder contains 54 cards: the 52 standard cards plus two jokers. Files are named by rank then suit, for example `AS.svg`, `10H.svg`, `KD.svg`, `Joker1.svg` and `Joker2.svg`.

## Prerequisites

* **Python 3**
* **resvg-py** (the SVG renderer, no system libraries needed):

      pip install resvg-py

* **optipng** (optional): if it is on your `PATH`, the script uses it to shrink the PNGs. If it's missing, the script prints a note and skips that step.
  * Windows: `winget install optipng`, or download it from [optipng.sourceforge.net][2]
  * macOS: `brew install optipng`
  * Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install optipng`

## Usage

    usage: svg2png.py [-h] -i INPUTDIR -o OUTPUTDIR [-v] [-x] [-n] -w WIDTH

    Generate fixed width PNGs from SVGs

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -i, --inputdir INPUTDIR
                            Input directory of SVGs
      -o, --outputdir OUTPUTDIR
                            Output directory of PNGs
      -v, --verbose         Verbose output
      -x, --nocrush         Don't optimize resulting PNGs
      -n, --dry-run         Show what would be done without doing it
      -w, --width WIDTH     PNG output width

The output directory is created if it doesn't exist. Existing PNGs with the same names are overwritten.

## Examples

* Convert to 300px wide PNGs without optimization, listing each file as it goes:

      python svg2png.py -v -x -i cards-svg -o cards-png-300px -w 300

* Convert to 691px wide PNGs, optimized with optipng if it's installed:

      python svg2png.py -i cards-svg -o cards-png-691px -w 691

* Show what would be generated without writing anything:

      python svg2png.py -n -i cards-svg -o cards-png-320px -w 320

## Card size and proportions

You choose only the width. The height follows from the card artwork, whose proportions are about 1 : 1.452 (each SVG's `viewBox` is 167.09 × 242.67). For example, 691px wide gives 691 × 1006.

To get a particular height, divide it by 1.452 to find the width. For example, `-w 688` gives cards about 1000px tall. For comparison, a standard poker card is 1 : 1.4 and a bridge card is about 1 : 1.556.

## Notes

* Unoptimized PNGs are roughly a third larger than ones run through optipng.
* The SVGs give their size in `pt` units, which resvg-py rejects. The script removes the unit before rendering, which doesn't change the output's proportions.

## License

These images, scripts and their output (for example, custom-sized PNGs) are released into the public domain, or optionally licensed under the [WTFPL][3] in jurisdictions where the public domain is not a recognized legal concept. Either way, do as you see fit: relicense, or embed in commercial, non-commercial or open-source software.
